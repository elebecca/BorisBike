Domanin Model

A domain model is an abstraction of an area of interest.

They consist of entities (in rectangles) and the relationships between them (as lines and arrows, and more generally in Unified Markup Language).

Domain models are one step in translating from user stories to class structures.

Feature test

Feature specs are high-level tests meant to exercise slices of functionality through an application.
